New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653.[26] The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[26][27] The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674.[28][29] New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[30] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.[31] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[32] and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[33] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[34] and environmental sustainability,[35][36] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[37] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.[38]
